Our world is divided into 2 extremes 
1) The Heavenly society [ aligory of extremely Socialist ecomony ] rule by Gabrille 
2) The Black Order [ aligory of extremely Capatilist economy ] ruled by Lucifer 

There however is no one who has ever ascended to the World Thorne [ the ruler of the whole planet ] 

Micheal and Lucifer are on a slatemate, and no other powers are powerful enough to challange them. 

However, in the past 3 brothers together went on the quest to conquere the whole
1) Micheal 
2) Lucifer 
3) Gabrille 

Michael was the person who was the most powerful and who I am going to link to Book 4: Minor Origin. 

Micheal gets tricked into killing his own wife ( when the wife asks to see Michael in full glory ).
Unable to live with the pain of losing his wife, Michael looses sanity. 
Seeing this change Gabrille kills Michael. 

This eventually leads to a clash between Lucifer and Gabrille - orginally both were following Micheal. 

Michael though is reborn as the main hero.
