Location: Divinity's Reach

Most powerful emperors of the planet band together do discuss issues facing the whole planet. 

Thanatos
"Everything Dies. 
You, me, everyone on this planet.
Our sun , our galaxy and eventually the universe itself.
This is simply how things are. 
It's inevitable and I accept it."

// There is a change in scene (Zeus)

We see one of the Kings looking up at the sky where they can see a planet hanging. 
From the planet comes down 1 young lady (Hera) and bunch of nameless goons.

Zeus: Who are you and why are you here
Hera: You speak english here, on it's one of those earths?
Zeus: ????
Hera: ????
Zeus: The world in the sky , is this your doing?
Hera: My doing? No man or woman can summon the incursion other than the Great One.
Zeus: ???
Hera: I came here to kill a world, would you try and stop me?
Zeus: I would do more than just try 
Hera: Then show me ?
*The goons start attacking Zeus
* Zeus is busy fighting and kicking their ass
Hera: May god have mercy on your souls 
*Hera creates an energy ball, sends it to the planet which blows apart in a blinding light *

// Few years ago
*We see Hera in a room with a giant panther goddess in front saying *
"Goddess, oh goddess, Save me from what this world demands. 
Please save me from what I am about to do"
